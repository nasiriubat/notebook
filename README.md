   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - Windows:
     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - Unix/MacOS:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Create a `.env` file in the backend directory:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/gpt_lab
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   ```

6. Run database migrations:
   ```bash
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

7. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

## Vector Database Options

The application supports three different vector storage options for the RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system:

### FAISS (Default)

FAISS is an efficient similarity search library developed by Facebook AI Research. It's fast and efficient for in-memory vector searches.

### ChromaDB

ChromaDB is a vector database that provides more advanced features like metadata filtering, persistence, and cloud deployment options.

Our ChromaDB implementation includes several advanced RAG features:

- **Semantic Chunking**: Intelligently splits documents at natural boundaries like paragraphs and sentences
- **Embedding Caching**: Reduces API costs by caching embeddings for reuse
- **Smart Query Processing**: Removes unnecessary words from queries to focus on key terms
- **Chunk Merging**: Combines adjacent chunks in search results for better context
- **Enhanced Text Cleaning**: Preserves important formatting while removing noise
- **Quality Thresholds**: Only returns high-quality matches above a similarity threshold

### Simple Vector Store

A lightweight alternative using sentence-transformers and numpy for vector similarity search. This option:
- Requires no compilation or complex dependencies
- Uses the efficient all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model for embeddings
- Provides good performance for smaller datasets
- Stores embeddings in simple JSON files
- Includes basic text preprocessing and chunking

### Switching Between Vector Stores

You can easily switch between FAISS, ChromaDB, and the Simple Vector Store by changing the `RAG_TYPE` environment variable in your backend `.env` file:

```
# For FAISS
RAG_TYPE=faiss

# For ChromaDB (with advanced RAG features)
RAG_TYPE=vector

# For Simple Vector Store (no compilation required)
RAG_TYPE=simple
```

The application will automatically use the specified vector store for all embedding storage and search operations. This allows you to:

1. Start with the Simple Vector Store for easy setup and testing
2. Switch to FAISS for better performance with larger datasets
3. Use ChromaDB for more complex scenarios or production environments
4. Test different systems to compare performance and results

Note: When switching between vector stores, previously stored embeddings won't be transferred automatically. You'll need to recreate your sources in the new system.
